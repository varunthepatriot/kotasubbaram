( Photo : ESA / Herschel / PACS / MESS Key Programme Supernova Remnant Team ; NASA, ESA and Allison Loll / Jeff Hester ( Arizona State University ) Narration ( from the Newspaper ) Deep inside the Crab Nebula, researchers have discovered the first evidence ever of a noble gas-based compound in space. A wallflower, argon is so reluctant to join with others that its name is the Greek word for i nactive. The element comes from the group known as noble gases , which includes helium and other similarly independent spirits. However, according to a new study published in the journal Science, argon appears to have found a friend. Using the Herschel space observatory , researchers detected signs of a molecule known as argon hydride in the nebula first noted by Chinese astronomers almost 1, 000 years ago.  At first, the discovery seemed bizarre, said lead researcher Michael Barlow from University College London.  With hot gas still expanding at high speeds after the explosion, a supernova remnant is a harsh, hostile environment , and one of the places where we least expected to find a noble-gas based molecule. Apparently, this was exactly what argon needed to get out of its comfort zone , the researchers found.  The strange thing is that it is the harsh conditions in a supernova remnant that seem to be responsible for some of the argon finding a partner with hydrogen, said Paul Goldsmith of NASA' s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif. ","Argon hydride is created when argon ions react with hydrogen molecules , though the two are usually found in completely different parts of a nebula .  But we soon realized that even in the Crab Nebula, there are places where the conditions are just right for a noble gas to react and combine with other elements , Barlow said. For these and other reasons, the researchers note the study is as much about the nebula as it is about argon.  This is not only the first detection of a noble-gas based molecule in space, but also a new perspective on the Crab Nebula, said Göran Pilbratt , Herschel project scientist at the European Space Agency.  Herschel has directly measured the argon isotope we expect to be produced via explosive nucleosynthesis in a core-collapse supernova, refining our understanding of the origin of this supernova remnant . –––––– NEWS ITEM ( NARRATION ) Courtesy: THE INDEPENDENT, SUNDAY, DECEMBER 2013 CRAB NEBULA: NOBLE GAS MOLECULES DETECTED IN SPACE FOR THE FIRST TIME Noble gas molecules have been detected in space for the first time ever, a team of astronomers has announced. The detection was made in the Crab Nebula, the remnants of a star that exploded 1 ,000 years ago and is 6,500 light years away, using the SPIRE ( Spectral and Photometric Imaging Receiver ) on board the European Space Agency’ s Herschel Space Observatory. The noble gases ( argon, helium, neon, xenon, radon, and krypton ) are chemically unreactive, and therefore do not easily combine with other elements. In the right circumstances, they can form molecules, although this had only ever been achieved on Earth in laboratory conditions. However, noble gas molecules in the form of argon hydride ions have now been detected outside the laboratory, in space. “Discovering argon hydride ions here was unexpected because you don ’ t expect an atom like argon, a noble gas, to form molecules, and you wouldn’ t expect to find them in the harsh environment of a supernova remnant,” said Professor Mike Barlow from University College London who led the study. ","Initially, Barlow’ s team of astronomers was looking to examine how exploding stars create such huge amounts of dust. But when studying emission lines ( the wavelengths emitted by molecules spinning in space ), the team noticed some unexpected readings. The light coming from some regions of the Crab Nebula was showing “ extremely strong and unexplained” peaks in intensity, ranging from 618 GHz to 1235 GHz. Upon consulting the databases of known properties of molecules, the scientists concluded that these wavelengths could only be coming from spinning molecular ions of argon hydride. The team further concluded that only the argon-36 isotope could rotate at such a rate. Scientists had previously hypothesized that the elements created by supernovas should include a lot of argon-36 and no argon-40, which was supported by the discovery. Professor Matt Griffin from Cardiff University said: “Here we see the excellent performance of the Herschel -SPIRE spectrometer, the expertise of the instrument team in producing the highest quality data, and the tenacity and vision of the scientists analyzing it , all coming together to make an intriguing new discovery.” –––––– NEWS ITEM ( NARRATION ) Courtesy: BUSINESS LINE, CHENNAI , INDIA, 24 APRIL 2014 MISSING NOBLE GAS TO BE REDISCOVERED: THE GAS XENON MAY BE RESTING IN EARTH’S BELLY The missing noble gas Xenon did not leave the earth’ s atmosphere and disappear into space but may be resting at the earth’s core, a thrilling new study reveals. Xenon is a noble gas. Like other noble gases such as Helium and Neon , it is mostly chemically inert. According to Chinese researchers, the mystery about where the gas vanished may finally be resolved. The scientists believe that Xenon might have chemically reacted with iron and nickel in the earth’ s core where it is held. The earth’s core, which contains about one-third of the planet’ s mass, is made of iron and nickel. According to Yanming Ma, a computational physicist at Jilin University in Changchun, China, the earth’ s core is more likely to hold the missing Xenon. Ma and his colleagues reasoned that if the structures of iron -xenon compounds are different, they could form a compound. ","Their research suggested that at the extreme temperatures and pressures found in earth ’ s core, Xenon can bond with both iron and nickel . “ We do hope future high-pressure experiments can be carried out to confirm our predictions .” Ma was quoted as saying in media reports. Comment by the presenter : The first observation by this presenter and his colleagues of spectra attributed to BeXe molecular ion in the laboratory was possible by passing Xenon gas at relatively higher pressures over beryllium chloride powder in a discharge tube .  ( Reference already given ) Offer : There are some diatomic molecules / molecular ions that are possible to be produced and identified in the laboratory experiments with beryllium as one of the atoms . This presenter is willing to correspond with anyone who is interested in proceeding with the expected research work, with a detailed experimental plan . –––––– Citation & Honour: Dr.G.Herzberg, Nobel laureate through a commendation letter ( written in 1978 ) about the discoveries ( see below ). -SD ","Note The above recommendation letter written sometime back by a Nobel laureate ( Dr. G.
