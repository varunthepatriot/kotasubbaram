It has been rightly observed: “Any universalized precept of education bereft of ethical and social mores is futile. The education process must lead to the enlightening of mind and soul in peoples for the general good of society rather than towards individual , inflated attitudes, and postures”. The article “ University Autonomy in the Context of New Education Policy ” is of only academic interest and has been included on the basis of a paper presented in a seminar on “ University Autonomy” organized by the Punjab University Teachers Association , Chandigarh, in January 1986. ","Anyway, the issue of university autonomy in this context has been highly controversial . This article is obviously based on the original document which has since then become “ The Programme of Action” and not the “ Challenge of Education”. There can, however, be no dispute with the author’ s stress on decentralization of the system at various levels . Education in human values is of paramount importance and universities are pledged to “ upholding and propagating universal values – human dignity, freedom, liberty, compassion, fraternity, charity, tolerance and such other cherish able virtues. Accordingly, the university structure is so constructed that people who apparently possess the desired universal values , that is teachers, form the pivot around which a university revolves . The teachers are expected to uphold and propagate the universal values , ideally speaking, even against severe odds.” The three suggestions made by the author in this regard are worthy of consideration by all . This book is in fact a collection of various published and unpublished articles and give us a peep into many issues strictly from the point of view of the author . One would disagree that the primary responsibility of a teacher is to teach and that the existing knowledge is meant to be transmitted to young minds. There is certainly a need for better teacher-student interaction and the teacher has a role beyond teaching . He has to be an agent of social change for the amelioration of society and the progress of the nation. I must commend the article on the role of the mother tongue and the regional language which the author has highlighted in a forthright manner . Since the days of Macaulay, we have not given a place of pride to our own languages , particularly in the realm of higher education. Departments have come up, pious decisions have been taken and much of slogan-mongering has been resorted to in the name of regional languages , in reality, nothing tangible has been achieved. The book contains some articles on science, scientists and scientific temper, including one on the Delhi Declaration on Nuclear Disarmament. Another article is on astrology . These are in fact old, old areas of discussion. One may or may not agree with views of the author but one thing is clear that they have been expressed in a clear and concise manner. The last chapter “The Critic, Performer, and the System” stimulates the thinking of the reader to form an opinion about the role of critic vis -à-vis performer. Appendices provide the proper background for understanding the viewpoint of the author on the various issues. Book Reviews The Mysore Economic Review (Bangalore) 1990 R. C. V.

","2 SCIENCE & SENSIBILITY: A CRITICAL INQUIRY INTO THE SCIENTIFIC TEMPER ( based on ‘A Statement on the Scientific Temper’ issued in 1981 by P.N.Haksar, some scientists, and others ) pp : 265 Published ( Ed. and Review ) : 1989 By: Manthan Publications Rohtak ( Haryana state ), India A BOUT THE BOOK Science & Sensibility contains articles that have appeared in various periodicals in response to the Statement on the Scientific Temper issued some time ago by some concerned scientists, thinkers, and public men of India. it includes a review of each of the articles collected. It also contains several other articles related to the scientific temper, appended with reviews. The book, essentially, is a comprehensive critical inquiry into the scientific temper. It is an important addition to the corpus of knowledge and contains a combat of differing ideas. Science & Sensibility is a valuable compendium aided with critical reviews and is the result of exhaustive and purposeful work. It is significant that the book is being brought out in the birth centenary year of Jawaharlal Nehru, the architect of the scientific temper and as a tribute to him. ","CONTENTS • A Statement On The Scientific Temper by P.N. Haksar and others • Published in Mainstream ( New Delhi ) • Counter-Statement On The Humanistic Temper by Ashis Nandy • Published in Mainstream ( New Delhi ) • and twenty-five other contributions to the discussion on the Scientific Temper Statement Reviews of the book National Herald (NEW DELHI) 1990 InderJit Lall S CIENTIFIC T EMPER “A consequence of the continued permeation of science and technology in our daily life that has occurred in an increasingly rapid pace in the last hundred years or so is a feeling of alienation from the world we live in ….. if we are to get rid ourselves of such a feeling of strangeness, we must make a serious effort to understand science and its underlying principles which has given us various marvels in the present world. This how and why of science can only be understood if popularization of science is done, and through it common man comes to terms with the world he lives in. Scientific temper is an ingredient for popularization of science. And we Indians need it all the more, for in a developing country like ours, this temper is a pre-requisite for a genuine progress in all spheres of human activity. A writer of popular science, as also the common reader, has to inculcate the scientific temper in him. Pandit Nehru was an arch exponent of scientific temper and this he expressed very well in his writings and speeches. K.V. Subbaram has compiled some twenty-five papers of the variegated aspects of scientific temper which saw the light of day in standard English dailies and journals during 1981-83. The compiler views that despite Pandit Nehru’s advocacy of the scientific temper we are witnessing a phenomenal growth of superstitious beliefs and obscurant practices in India. Thus, our national scene deserves a survey which these articles provide well. The scientific temper syndrome has drawn and earned wide opinions and reactions because it is a scientific term and it has a big connotation. The compiler prefaces his argument: “Inherent in the scientific temper is a system of value judgements. The inculcation of his temper in our society would result in our people becoming rational and objective, thereby generating a climate favouring an egalitarian, democratic, secular, and universal outlook.” This subject otherwise involves a wide variation of views. In any case, these essays are useful for all ","sections of the people for creating a fruitful consciousness of the ‘temper’ notwithstanding we are sensitive to our spiritual ideas and heritage.” Indian Journal of Science Communication (Lucknow) 2003 Rakesh Popli (now no more) S CIENTIFIC T EMPER : AN I SSUE ABOVE I DEOLOGIES ′….. Science and Sensibility is a compilation of articles and letters on scientific temper, carried mainly by two magazines, Mainstream and Secular Democracy, during 1981–82. Each article is reviewed by the compiler, Dr. K.V. Subbaram, who is a professor of Physics, prominent science activist, and poet. The book begins with A Statement on the Scientific Temper prepared and signed in1981 by several dozen eminent public persons led by P.N. Haksar ( former Principal Secretary to Prime Minister Indira Gandhi ), Dr.Raja Ramanna ( former Secretary, Atomic Enegy Commission ) and Dr. P.M. Bhargava ( reputed microbiologist ). The signatories come from diverse backgrounds (within the English-speaking elite circle ) – there are scientists, social scientists, policy-makers and social workers. Hardly any of them are experts in the methodology / philosophy of science. They have various individual concerns as reflected in their respective subsequent articles included in the book. The Statement ( or the Manifesto, as we shall refer to it ) underlines the importance of propagating scientific temper among the masses in making a resurgent India. It makes a strong plea for inculcating a spirit of enquiry and questioning of the existing order. It also points out that a systematic and planned utilization of our technological capabilities ( and human faculties in general ) to solve our national problems is not possible in the absence of scientific temper. It explains that scientific temper is not just knowledge of scientific facts nor rationalism but an outlook and process leading to an ordered understanding of man and his environment. However, when it lays down four attributes of scientific temper, the above broad and universal approach to scientific temper gives way to an exclusive emphasis on a particular knowledge-system, viz. the method of science. In particular, it proclaims the doctrine that one must question whatever is incompatible with science-generated knowledge. Further, values like equality of human beings and distributive justice are somehow sought to be made parts of scientific temper. Elements of western ideologies are also imported into the Manifesto when it sees the human being solely as the ‘maker of destiny’ ( underplaying the ′spectator′ aspect ). It ends by not only condemning superstitions and irrational ways of making decisions, but also lamenting havans and yajnas, ′irrational health practices′ and ′food fads′. At one point, Nandy′s sharp criticism of the Manifesto itself becomes the centre of the debate. He examines each line of the Manifesto ( and reads between the lines ) and brings out hidden connotations rather loudly ( and uncharitably ). He appears reasonable when he asserts that, in social matters and even in material ones, the scientist’s decision may not be unquestionable. ","But then he goes further and associates science with war and destruction. He even charges that the Manifesto’s plea for the fullest use of science in everyday life and in every aspect of human behaviour from ethics to politics and economics ..... is a call for the destruction of all spontaneity, rebellion, and wisdom. However, the subsequent injunctions issued by Subbaram and several others, to worship science like a god that can never be questioned except by the method of science itself, appear to justify Nandy’s scepticism to an extent. The problem with most articles, starting with parts of the Manifesto itself, is a kind of fundamentalism, particularly a generous use of blanket statements. If the scientific spirit and curiosity is one wonderful human faculty, the Manifesto appears to belittle, even deride, other faculties. The debate is not without its use, though: many partial truths and mutually conflicting viewpoints are thrown about, which the reader can try to join together and make a wholesome picture. Most debaters throw a good deal of mud at religion, rituals, ‘obscurantism’ and ‘god-men’. Significantly, the issue is not joined on behalf of religion and faith by anyone except by the much-criticized Nandy. Interestingly, the attack on religion comes with reference to the good old Galileo episode. The relevance for us of Galileo’s tiff with the fundamentalist Christian church of medieval Europe is not clear, considering that there was never any such persecution or inquisition in Hindu India. Nevertheless, the Manifesto appears to hold the deep-rooted structures of ( our ) ancient society as the chief obstacle to the propagation of scientific temper in India. The review of each article by Subbaram is a mixed bag. He is quite sharp, hilarious at times and virulent at others. His baseline for criticism is his unshakable faith in science, the scientific method and western liberal human values, coupled with a compulsive scorn for religion, particularly of the Hindu variety. He sharply attacks virtually all Indian scientists for having spirit ( spirituality ) in their veins instead of science and bemoans the tragic fact that Bhabha chose such scientists as his associates. He ends by calling for a purge of all such scientists from the ranks of the scientific temper movement …..  ","3 INDIAN UNIVERSITIES & SYSTEMIC AILMENTS ( a critique of the Draft Report of ‘ Association of Indian Universities’, New Delhi, on regulatory provisions for appointment / dismissal of vice-chancellors ) pp : 161 Published : 1993 By: Harman Publishing House New Delhi, India About the book This work contains the text of the Draft Report released sometime ago by the Association of Indian Universities ( AIU ) based on the findings of a Committee of Elders constituted by the AIU regarding the malaise afflicting the university system in the states of Bihar, Orissa, and Madhya Pradesh and in the country at large. A critical review of the Draft Report appears as a response to an appeal made by the AIU to concerned individuals and institutions. The work also includes some pertinent questions and answers to some important issues such as : establishment, structure, and role of universities ; mode of appointment of vice-chancellors and terms and conditions of appointment ; governor-chancellor dichotomy ; role of the state governments, the central government, the state assemblies and parliament and of national organizations like the University Grants Commission and the AIU itself in contributing to a professional and purposeful working of universities in the country. Indian Universities & Systemic Ailments is a timely and worthwhile addition to the already existing literature on related topics. It is the result of concerted efforts to bring together and ","highlight the relevant issues including remedial measures for the process of nation-building, specially keeping in view the present turbulent social conditions.

Under certain rigorous epistemological criteria in the philosophical framework various past civilizations in the world have been examined to locate the beginnings of science . It has been found that the Greek culture in antiquity together with human reason could provide the necessary environment for the genesis of science. Science was found to have spread and grown to ultimately become a common and shared heritage of mankind. Certain futuristic trends have been outlined in this work. This study leads the reader through a voyage of science on time scale in the historical sense and with a conceptual base in the philosophical space. Contents Preface K.V.

The sincerity, honesty, integrity and the personal sacrifice of each one of the editors as individuals; the keen observation of social events and political happenings during the Indian Independence Movement expressed with courage, forthrightness, and with an uncompromising attitude in their respective periodicals of the times; and the zeal and enthusiasm with which they informed and inspired the reading public to join hands together in the Indian Independence Movement willingly – all these are brought out in this book by the translator-authors in an impressive manner. The professional journalistic ethics which the luminaries, belonging to the Telugu-speaking region, pioneeringly expounded and unfailingly followed all through, as detailed in each of the sixteen sub-texts of this book, serve as beacons of Indian ","journalistic heritage in general and could as well guide today’s and tomorrow’s journalists worldwide and even enliven the field of journalism.
