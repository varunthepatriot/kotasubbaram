To find the efficacy of these medicines associated with the traditional practices, they were prepared following quality standards and prescribed in this trial, each as a part of Ayurvedic treatment regimen supplement ( to allopathic medicines ), to patients with Type 2 diabetes. Mudga Churna – a fine powder of Phaseolous mungo with no known effect in madhumeha, was also used for comparison purposes. 37 patients of madhumeha, divided into three groups, were prescribed the three treatment regimens that included diet and exercise. Assessment of efficacy with reference to baseline data, follow-up at the end of forty days, eighty days and 120 days was done using a self-designed proforma based on Ayurvedic system with the help of the primary symptoms polyuria, nocturia, excessive thirst, excessive appetite, weight loss, weakness, tingling sensation in the extremities, numbness in the extremities, burning sensation in the palms and feet ; and associated symptoms – excessive sweating, lethargy. Symptomatic relief was found in each of the three groups of patients. Significant ( p = 0.014 ) reduction of 0.96 in mean HbA1c ( % ) was noticed at the end of the 120 days treatment period in the Nyagrodhadi Churna group. No major treatment emergent side effects were observed and no variance in the values of the considered liver and renal parameters was found during the treatment period in the three groups. The study ascertains the ‘efficacy’ of the three treatment regimens with Nyagrodhadi Churna, Nishamalaki and Mudga Churna when administered to patients of madhumeha, each as a part of Ayurvedic treatment regimen supplement for a period of 120 days. It also reveals the relative efficacy of Nyagrodhadi Churna regimen over the two treatment regimens. –––––– The work in the Trust had to be discontinued because of lack of financial support, which had undertaken the research and translation work. *** "]
