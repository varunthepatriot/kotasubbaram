                                The article “University Autonomy in the Context of New Education Policy” is of only academic
interest and has been included on the basis of a paper presented in a seminar on “University
Autonomy” organized by the Punjab University Teachers Association, Chandigarh, in January
1986.
Anyway, the issue of university autonomy in this context has been highly controversial. This
article is obviously basedon the original document which has since then become “The
Programme of Action” and not the “Challenge of Education”. There can, however, be no
dispute with the author’s stress on decentralization of the system at various levels.
Education in human values is of paramount importance and universities are pledged to
“upholding and propagating universal values – human dignity, freedom, liberty, compassion,
fraternity, charity, tolerance and such other cherishable virtues. Accordingly, the university
structure is so constructed that people who apparently possess the desired universal values,
that is teachers, form the pivot around which a university revolves. The teachers are expected
to uphold and propagate the universal values, ideally speaking, even against severe odds.” The
three suggestions made by the author in this regard are worthy of consideration by all.
This book is in fact a collection of various published and unpublished articles and give us a peep
into many issues strictly from the point of view of the author. One would disagree that the
primary responsibility of a teacher is to teach and that the existing knowledge is meant to be
transmitted to young minds. There is certainly a need for better teacher-student interaction
and the teacher has a role beyond teaching. He has to be an agent of social change for the
amelioration of society and the progress of the nation.
I must commend the article on the role of the mother tongue and the regional language which
the author has highlighted in a forthright manner. Since the days of Macaulay, we have not
given a place of pride to our own languages, particularly in the realm of higher education.
Departments have come up, pious decisions have been taken and much of slogan-mongering
has been resorted to in the name of regional languages, in reality, nothing tangible has been
achieved.
The book contains some articles on science, scientists and scientific temper, including one on
the Delhi Declaration On Nuclear Disarmament. Another article is on astrology. These are in
fact old, old areas of discussion. One may or may not agree with views of the author but one
thing is clear that they have been expressed in a clear and concise manner.
The last chapter “The Critic, Performer, and the System” stimulates the thinking of the reader
to form an opinion about the role of critic vis-à-vis performer.
Appendices provide the proper background for understanding the viewpoint of the author on
the various issues.
