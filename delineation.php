                      WebHome span a period of over <b style="color: green ; font-size: larger">Fifty years</b> of work and related activities of the <b>COW</b>, and
                      responses
                      received from some accomplished peers referring to the importance and significance of his efforts.
                      It may be mentioned that it has taken a period of about a decade to collect and organize the
                      entire material to form a meaningful whole for the preparation of this WebHome.

                      To the best of the knowledge and information of the <b>COW</b>, this is the only WebHome that has
                      dealt with the subjects / fields / domains that are considered for award of the <b style="color: #0000FF">Nobel Prize</b>.
                      Also, the <b>COW</b>, is the only individual who has ventured into working to the extent that even
                      <b style="color: #0000FF">Nobel Prize</b> winners were drawn to his discoveries in the scientific field, and eminent
                      scholars in the other domains found his contributions significant and so were
                      appreciative.
                      <br/>

                      These facts endow uniqueness to the work of the <b>COW</b>, which he has
                      been able to do spanning a period of <b style="color: green ; font-size: larger">Fifty years</b>, which is a global challenge. Within the material
                      contained in the WebHome, there are links and relevant sub-links that lead
                      the reader / browser to his points of curiosity and interest.

                      For the notes given in the material of the WebHome, the <b>COW</b> has taken the opportunity
                      to acquaint the readers / browsers, young and old, with the traditions that science and scientists
                      follow throughout the world.

                      The <b>COW</b> thought it to be judicious to delete the signatures of the various personalities
                      appended to their letters in this WebHome as a matter of propriety and due respect,
                      and has presented contents of their respective letters as such. The original signed letters,
                      however, are available with <br>the <b>COW</b> .

                      The <b>COW</b> has visualized and desired that the contents of the WebHome are to be offered
                      for discussion so as to make the WebHome stomping and interactive. Two separate pages
                      ‘Our Page’ and ‘Your Page’ have been created to enable meaningful and lively
                      interaction to take place between the <b>COW</b> and the readers / browsers, as also among the
                      readers / browsers themselves, considering ‘Your Page’ as a platform for exchange of views and so on.

                      The <b>COW</b> takes pride in the fact that for all the work that is quoted as the contents of
                      this
                      WebHome, he has not personally approached or used any opportunistic means to get the
                      work initially published in the several newspapers, magazines, journals, scientific
                      periodicals, and so on. The extensive work presented in this WebHome has been provided
                      the respective platforms of publication by the editors after independent scrutiny, based
                      entirely on the importance and significance of the contents and style of presentation.
