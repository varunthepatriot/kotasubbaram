MAKING AN IDEAL CITIZE N
From early settlers and “scriptology” and Renaissance in the West and “scientology” to British
contribution and the future role of educationists in India, the author has competently
presented the evolving scenario with historical perspective in the very first two chapters. It has
been rightly observed: “Any universalized precept of education bereft of ethical and social
mores is futile. The education process must lead to the enlightening of mind and soul in
peoples for the general good of society rather than towards individual, inflated attitudes, and
postures”.</page>
        <page isMac="false" Index="4">The article “University Autonomy in the Context of New Education Policy” is of only academic
interest and has been included on the basis of a paper presented in a seminar on “University
Autonomy” organized by the Punjab University Teachers Association, Chandigarh, in January
1986.
Anyway, the issue of university autonomy in this context has been highly controversial. This
article is obviously basedon the original document which has since then become “The
Programme of Action” and not the “Challenge of Education”. There can, however, be no
dispute with the author’s stress on decentralization of the system at various levels.
Education in human values is of paramount importance and universities are pledged to
“upholding and propagating universal values – human dignity, freedom, liberty, compassion,
fraternity, charity, tolerance and such other cherishable virtues. Accordingly, the university
structure is so constructed that people who apparently possess the desired universal values,
that is teachers, form the pivot around which a university revolves. The teachers are expected
to uphold and propagate the universal values, ideally speaking, even against severe odds.” The
three suggestions made by the author in this regard are worthy of consideration by all.
This book is in fact a collection of various published and unpublished articles and give us a peep
into many issues strictly from the point of view of the author. One would disagree that the
primary responsibility of a teacher is to teach and that the existing knowledge is meant to be
transmitted to young minds. There is certainly a need for better teacher-student interaction
and the teacher has a role beyond teaching. He has to be an agent of social change for the
amelioration of society and the progress of the nation.
I must commend the article on the role of the mother tongue and the regional language which
the author has highlighted in a forthright manner. Since the days of Macaulay, we have not
given a place of pride to our own languages, particularly in the realm of higher education.
Departments have come up, pious decisions have been taken and much of slogan-mongering
has been resorted to in the name of regional languages, in reality, nothing tangible has been
achieved.
The book contains some articles on science, scientists and scientific temper, including one on
the Delhi Declaration On Nuclear Disarmament. Another article is on astrology. These are in
fact old, old areas of discussion. One may or may not agree with views of the author but one
thing is clear that they have been expressed in a clear and concise manner.
The last chapter “The Critic, Performer, and the System” stimulates the thinking of the reader
to form an opinion about the role of critic vis-à-vis performer.
Appendices provide the proper background for understanding the viewpoint of the author on
the various issues.

THE REVIEW
Education plays a great role in spreading knowledge and providing skills. It opens window to
the world. The present is a scientific and technological era. India has many pasts which have
contributed to Indian civilization. Man is facing a conflict between tradition and modernity. The
author, an educationist, has written many articles on different aspects of education. This book
is a collection of several articles written in the last decade on education, science, and society.
To enable the reader to understand the context in which the articles were written 8 appendices
have been added. The ideas put forth in these essays stimulate deeper thinking, provoke
discussion for more ideas. These ideas tend to create a dynamic society. Present system of
school education prescribing curricula, conducting examinations not allowing the students
their freedom to develop their talents. Subjects are forced on them, knowledge about
everything should be available to each person in a manner that suits him. This book helps the
reader to develop a rational and humane outlook.</page>

ABOUT THE BOOK
Science &amp; Sensibility contains articles that have appeared in various periodicals in response to the Statement
on the Scientific Temper issued some time ago by some concerned scientists, thinkers, and public men of India
; it includes a review of each of the articles collected. It also contains several other articles related to the
scientific temper, appended with reviews.
The book, essentially, is a comprehensive critical inquiry into the scientific temper. It is an important addition
to the corpus of knowledge and contains a combat of differing ideas.
Science &amp; Sensibility is a valuable compendium aided with critical reviews and is the result of exhaustive and
purposeful work. It is significant that the book is being brought out in the birth centenary year of Jawaharlal
Nehru, the architect of the scientific temper and as a tribute to him.</page>

SCIENTIFIC TEMPER
“A consequence of the continued permeation of science and technology in our daily life that has occurred in an
increasingly rapid pace in the last hundred years or so is a feeling of alienation from the world we live in ….. if
we are to get rid ourselves of such a feeling of strangeness, we must make a serious effort to understand science
and its underlying principles which has given us various marvels in the present world. This how and why of
science can only be understood if popularization of science is done, and through it common man comes to terms
with the world he lives in. Scientific temper is an ingredient for popularization of science. And we Indians need
it all the more, for in a developing country like ours, this temper is a pre-requisite for a genuine progress in all
spheres of human activity. A writer of popular science, as also the common reader, has to inculcate the scientific
temper in him. Pandit Nehru was an arch exponent of scientific temper and this he expressed very well in his
writings and speeches.
K.V. Subbaram has compiled some twenty-five papers of the variegated aspects of scientific temper which saw
the light of day in standard English dailies and journals during 1981-83. The compiler views that despite Pandit
Nehru’s advocacy of the scientific temper we are witnessing a phenomenal growth of superstitious beliefs and
obscurant practices in India. Thus, our national scene deserves a survey which these articles provide well. The
scientific temper syndrome has drawn and earned wide opinions and reactions because it is a scientific term and
it has a big connotation.
The compiler prefaces his argument: “Inherent in the scientific temper is a system of value judgements. The
inculcation of his temper in our society would result in our people becoming rational and objective, thereby
generating a climate favouring an egalitarian, democratic, secular, and universal outlook.” This subject
otherwise involves a wide variation of views. In any case, these essays are useful for all sections of the people
for creating a fruitful consciousness of the ‘temper’ notwithstanding we are sensitive to our spiritual ideas and
heritage.”</page>

SCIENTIFIC TEMPER : AN ISSUE ABOVE IDEOLOGIES
′….. Science and Sensibility is a compilation of articles and letters on scientific temper,
carried mainly by two magazines, Mainstream and Secular Democracy, during 1981–82. Each article is reviewed
by the compiler, Dr. K.V. Subbaram, who is a professor of Physics, prominent science activist, and poet.
The book begins with A Statement on the Scientific Temper prepared and signed in1981 by several dozen
eminent public persons led by P.N. Haksar ( former Principal Secretary to Prime Minister Indira Gandhi ), Dr.Raja
Ramanna ( former Secretary, Atomic Energy Commission ) and Dr. P.M. Bhargava ( reputed microbiologist ).
The signatories come from diverse backgrounds (within the English-speaking elite circle ) – there are scientists,
social scientists, policy-makers and social workers.
Hardly any of them are experts in the methodology / philosophy of science.
They have various individual concerns as reflected in their respective subsequent articles included in the book.
The Statement ( or the Manifesto, as we shall refer to it ) underlines the importance of propagating scientific
temper among the masses in making a resurgent India. It makes a strong plea for inculcating a spirit of enquiry
and questioning of the existing order. It also points out that a systematic and planned utilization of our
technological capabilities ( and human faculties in general ) to solve our national problems is not possible in the
absence of scientific temper. It explains that scientific temper is not just knowledge of scientific facts nor
rationalism but an outlook and process leading to an ordered understanding of man and his environment.
However, when it lays down four attributes of scientific temper, the above broad and universal approach to
scientific temper gives way to an exclusive emphasis on a particular knowledge-system, viz. the method of
science.
In particular, it proclaims the doctrine that one must question whatever is incompatible with science-generated
knowledge. Further, values like equality of human beings and distributive justice are somehow sought to be
made parts of scientific temper. Elements of western ideologies are also imported into the Manifesto when it
sees the human being solely as the ‘maker of destiny’ ( underplaying the ′spectator′ aspect ). It ends by not only
condemning superstitions and irrational ways of making decisions, but also lamenting havans and yajnas,
′irrational health practices′ and ′food fads′. At one point, Nandy′s sharp criticism of the Manifesto itself becomes
the centre of the debate. He examines each line of the Manifesto ( and reads between the lines ) and brings out
hidden connotations rather loudly ( and uncharitably ). He appears reasonable when he asserts that, in social
matters and even in material ones, the scientist’s decision may not be unquestionable.
But then he goes further and associates science with war and destruction. He even charges that the Manifesto’s
plea "for the fullest use of science in everyday life and in every aspect of human behaviour from ethics to politics
and economics ....." is a call for the destruction of all spontaneity, rebellion, and wisdom. However, the
subsequent injunctions issued by Subbaram and several others, to worship science like a god that can never be</page>
        <page isMac="false" Index="9">questioned except by the method of science itself, appear to justify Nandy’s skepticism to an extent.
The problem with most articles, starting with parts of the Manifesto itself, is a kind
of fundamentalism, particularly a generous use of blanket statements. If the scientific
spirit and curiosity is one wonderful human faculty, the Manifesto appears to belittle,
even deride, other faculties. The debate is not without its use, though: many partial truths and mutually
conflicting viewpoints are thrown about, which the reader can try to join together and make a wholesome
picture. Most debaters throw a good deal of mud at religion, rituals, ‘obscurantism’ and ‘god-men’. Significantly,
the issue is not joined on behalf of religion and faith by anyone except by the much-criticized Nandy.
Interestingly, the attack on religion comes with reference to the good old Galileo episode. The relevance for us
of Galileo’s tiff with the fundamentalist Christian church of medieval Europe is not clear, considering that there
was never any such persecution or inquisition in Hindu India. Nevertheless, the Manifesto appears to hold the
"deep-rooted structures of ( our ) ancient society" as the chief obstacle to the propagation of scientific temper
inIndia.
The review of each article by Subbaram is a mixed bag. He is quite sharp, hilarious at times and virulent at others.
His baseline for criticism is his unshakable faith in science, the scientific method and western liberal human
values, coupled with a compulsive scorn for religion, particularly of the Hindu variety. He sharply attacks virtually
all Indian scientists for having "spirit ( spirituality ) in their veins instead of science" and bemoans "the tragic
fact" that Bhabha chose such scientists as his associates. He ends by calling for a purge of all such scientists from
the ranks of the scientific temper movement ….. "</page>

( A CRITIQUE OF THE DRAFT REPORT OF ‘ASSOCIATION OF INDIAN UNIVERSITIES ’, NEW DELHI,
ON REGULATORY PROVISIONS FOR APPOINTMENT / DISMISSAL OF VICE -CHANCELLORS )
pp : 161
Published : 1993
By: Harman Publishing House
New Delhi, India
ABOUT THE BOOK
This work contains the text of the Draft Report released sometime ago by the Association of Indian Universities
( AIU ) based on the findings of a Committee of Elders constituted by the AIU regarding the malaise afflicting
the university system in the states of Bihar, Orissa, and Madhya Pradesh and in the country at large. A critical
review of the Draft Report appears as a response to an appeal made by the AIU to concerned individuals and
institutions. The work also includes some pertinent questions and answers to some important issues such as :
establishment, structure, and role of universities ; mode of appointment of vice-chancellors and terms and
conditions of appointment ; governor-chancellor dichotomy ; role of the state governments, the central
government, the state assemblies and parliament and of national organizations like the University Grants
Commission and the AIU itself in contributing to a professional and purposeful working of universities in the
country.
Indian Universities &amp; Systemic Ailments is a timely and worthwhile addition to the already
existing literature on related topics. It is the result of concerted efforts to bring together and</page>

pp : 244
Published : 1998
By: Haryana Vigyan Manch
Rohtak ( Haryana state ), India
ABOUT THE BOOK
This work deals with the general principles on which science and scientific knowledge are based. Under certain
rigorous epistemological criteria in the philosophical framework various past civilizations in the world have been
examined to locate the beginnings of science. It has been found that the Greek culture in antiquity together with
human reason could provide the necessary environment for the genesis of science. Science was found to have
spread and grown to ultimately become a common and shared heritage of mankind. Certain futuristic trends
have been outlined in this work. This study leads the reader through a voyage of science on time scale in the
historical sense and with a conceptual base in the philosophical space.
