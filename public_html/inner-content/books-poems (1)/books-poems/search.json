It reasserts the fact that suffering and sorrow form the essential ingredients of the human condition. Note: No long-hand version of From Me To You exists. The material was created straight out of the mind in twenty -five 2-hour sittings at the typewriter in the summer of 1978. Reviews of the book Amrit Bazar Patrika ( Kolkata ) 18 October 1987 By Sisir Kumar Ghose ( Formerly a professor of English at Viswa Bharathi, a University at Santiniketan established by Rabindranath Tagore, Nobel Prize winner for Literature in 1913 ) ","Metatwinkle, Metatwinkle This metaphysical monologue, a non-stop reverie, is quite a thing. This 134-page book has but one paragraph, a pretty modern touch. Here is a cute commentary not on How to Live, but on How It Is. Sophisticated, yet – because of undisguised self-pity – not unsentimental . The authorial ‘ I’ projects a fantasy journey through the other realms. But there is little that is post-mortem or extra-territorial that is not a narrative . Really, we see the familiar world through another focus or perspective. Stimulating but also a little exhausting. Imagine Hamlet as one soliloquy. To take From Me To You at one gulp will not be safe. Rippling on the flux are vivid vignettes in which , as in a convex mirror, we recognize ourselves. A complete cycle, the first sentence says, “ I am born” and the last, “ I die”. A package recollection, rarely in tranquility, is this not, at one level, your life and mine ? Here are a few specimens, enough to attract or to keep away. To begin with what is perhaps the main theme. “ A game that is part of a greater game. It is so big that no one has comprehended it or tried to comprehend it .” The game, the mystery of mysteries, whose other name is life, especially in the coils of self-consciousness. About childhood, perhaps of every child, the lay narrator remembers, “ I ease myself and cry. And cry so loud, that mother rushes from the kitchen, where all the eatables are kept and new ones prepared. Only to eat and defecate the next morning or afternoon or in the evening whenever one feels like it. Mother always allows me to crawl after wiping my behind and sweeping the floor. All mothers don’ t do that. Some like it, some hate it and some tolerate it. Crawling has been a pastime and many expect me to do it even now. But it hurts. I cannot compete with the other reptiles. Both poisonous and non-poisonous. Or venomous and non-venomous ?” But, as in other passages, the cleverness and cynicism are not unmixed with pathos. But, listen, later to the lament of the Mother: “ Ah ! Why should I compare you with a flower ? That is too gentle. Probably, a stone would be better. A stone that stays at one place. No life, no movement. No learning, no knowledge. Unless you put all your efforts right from now in your studies you would be damned for the rest of your life. That means that you do not have much brains. To think like others do. To study like others do. To get educated like others do. To get jobs like others do. To get promotions like others do. To get important. To get power. To make me feel proud. To make me feel happy to have produced you. But about you I do not even have the remotest streak of hope. I am exasperated with you. Frustrated with you. I feel throttled with you hanging about ","the house. I would rather leave you and rather go away to some far-off place and get lost. And disown you completely. But our metaphysical mega mind is capable of larger wheelings. Here he is in the role of an ET observer. “ My soul watches all the other galaxies from this galaxy . And finds that the life forms are innumerable. And much more sophisticated. And much more advanced. And much more efficient . Much more involved. They seem to be weary about strangers. But they don’ t seem so much insecure. As we do here. With all kind of fears and problems. Inside the mind. With all kinds of dreary imaginations. About the problems that don’ t exist. Earthlings are weaklings . Both in mind and body. Souls exist inside the bodies. A secret fact is for most they too die with the body. So nothing escapes the body after the end . But for a few the soul goes free. Free to wander. Anywhere it can go. To other planets, to other galaxies, even to outside this universe. ” Here are some comments on Nature and the nature of things , as seen in the busy bee. “ The bees that buzz in the ears . Annoy people until they go crazy. The same bees now become hustlers. They steal the nectar and leave the flowers lifeless. And then they land on the neighbouring flowers … and help pollination. That is indirect mating. Without any feelings. Without any love. Without any touch. The net result is: more flowers. The bees break laws. All the natural laws. But they help Nature to grow into beauty, into mystery. So mysterious that a million brains are engaged to unravel its mysteries. Day in and day out. Weeks on, months on, years on, decades on, the bees are the culprits.” But all things end. Time must have a stop. For all its resilience, the fin-du-globe the end-of the-world mood is unmistakable. Listen to an imaginary but satirical report of an interplanetary peace meeting. “ A lone voice reads out. No more hatred. No more belligerence. No more bullyings. No more pacts. No more threats. No more invasions. No more wars. No more destructions and deaths. Clapping. Only there is a shriek from a member of a smaller planet . What is the matter ? He says that his neighbour, a member of the bigger planet, has pinched his bottom. Everyone cries: “ Shame ! Shame ! and vanishes. “ Is this the way the world will end ? Rich in subterranean significance, these random reflections of a modern soul in crisis, at once sad and funny, are a teaser and something new on the Indo-Anglian horizon. Had the book been published abroad it would have created a sensation not less than that of Desani books or of other Western masters of free association and psychic discontinuity . Here it is likely to be ignored. ","Read a few pages of this intelligent, imaginative, bizarre, brilliant book before you decide . You will not be jaded. A bit dazed maybe. A new star. Metatwinkle, Metatwinkle. ––––– The Hindu ( Madras / Chennai ) 3 April 1984 By P.S.N. A hungry heart  …..   a kind of genius “ This is superb literature of revolt against the vicious trends of contemporary civilization ….. Our present situation is without precedent in history. Whereas in all previous generations, man lived only with the prospect of his death as an individual , the present generation is the first to face the prospect of the death of our species. The tragedy takes the form of self-destruction, when we realize that the underlying cause is the paranoid split in man between rational thinking and irrational affect -based beliefs, and the contrast between our genius in conquering Nature and our ineptitude in managing our own affairs. The theme has, of course, been covered by other authors , but we do not seem to be convinced of the moral collapse of the present system. So spectacular has been the advance of technology in our time, that science itself has come to belong to the quest for power, not truth, and developed such idiot-conceit that super-powers can still pretend to lay down new standards of public morality based only on competitive technology. Yet, the march of events has its own momentum and seems now directed towards the final denouement – to clear the way for some new framework for civilized collective living, and give a purposive direction for the whole process of civilization. This demands not political readjustments, but a change in men’ s hearts and minds. “ Do you imagine” asks Plato in the Republic, that political constitutions spring from a tree or a rock and not from the dispositions of citizens, who turn the scale and turn all else in their direction? We require a new structure of thought , a new realism and idealism to understand and force our highly complicated problems . This has, since history began, been the contribution of intellectuals and heretics who are capable of seeing into the mystery of things. “ as if they are God’ s spies”. Professor Subbaram promises to be one such. From Me To You is an intimate narration of his soul ’ s journey around the world and in the outer space – all as if in sleep, and in the first ten years of his ","life – in the form of an imaginary conversation between himself and his mother living in poverty. Mother, why did you have to suffer so much bringing me here ? The world that is so imperfect. There is no wisdom anywhere, only stupidity, no charity, no parity, only arrogance and exploitation. How can we expect ourselves to be civilized , evolved ? The journey around the world is visualized as a visit to a Park with many paths – one probably leading to Heaven, another to Hell, and another to Purgatory. Like in Dante’s Inferno the rest all leading to dead ends . But all coming back to the starting point. A labyrinthine maze “ It appears it is not easy to reach Heaven. There is no short cut to it . The easy way attracts people. But I shall crawl . For me uphill is easier than downhill.” On his way, he sees a bewildering variety of people – exerted, angry, gesticulating, distressed, mad. “ If he bears his trouble successfully, he becomes insane. But insanity in regular doses keeps the world going with new ideas, for civilizations to come to life, thrive for a time and then to decay.” The insights gained in the long journey are assembled in a coherent synthesis, from sub-atomic physics to metaphysics . Every page reflects his spiritual distress over the paranoid streak in man. The treatment is original , homely. He writes to shake his readers out of their placid habits and prejudices . The compulsive readability of the book stems from his honesty, courage, and humour ; the savage lyricism of his prose; and from his plea for a spiritual re-awakening, as the cure for the pathology of the human mind . A moving spiritual odyssey. ––––– National Herald ( New Delhi ) June 3, 1984 By C.V. Krishnamurthy A non-conformist monologue At first the cover design of the book fits into the labyrinth of metaphysics. A background with the legend “ From Me” and “ to you” in font types on black triangular forms is indeed typical of philosophic frame of mind the author has rightly donned. The design is by the author himself . It is an abstract subject, as he confesses about the creation of the monologue , straight out of the mind onto the typewriter in twenty -five two-hour sittings. The author deserves praise for the effort which indeed would not be easy of achievement . What he has driven home is the mundane fact of suffering and sorrow which form the essential ingredients of human condition. The monologue reflects the sub-conscious mind as of slumber and sleep or trance. All the same it must be observed that the sub-conscious is not that easy of arousing , unless one is trained in meditation. ","At best the book brings out random thoughts or imagination of the casual nature of life that the author has been able to highlight. A mere state of trance and its consequential train of events which flow as in a reel of film does not give the stamp of monologue effect. The revelation of the ‘ I’ and ‘ anti-I’ and the conflict between the two is no pointer to any tangible idea, at least in this book. Mr. K. V. Subbaram has creative literary talents. A distinguished post-graduate from Banaras Hindu University and Ph. D. from the Indian Institute of Technology , Kanpur, he teaches physics to post -graduate students in M. D. University, Rohtak. This science background has conferred on him valuable knowledge of astrophysics. In his monologue, Mr. Subbaram seemed to this critic a pessimist. He has attempted, doubtless with understanding to capture the spirit of Dante’ s purgatory. The journey through heaven hell and what not is referred to. His sub-conscious experience narrates his journey to the nether world. And he chats with “ strange life-beings” in the comets in space orbiting in procession, he encounters the Jupiter , Saturn, other planets and the milky way. He says he is in quest of ‘I’ and ‘ anti -I’. True, this book is written in unconventional style. The author claims it is a new brew of the spirit of Indo-Anglican fiction. As far as this critic could lay his hands on Celtic classics , local legends are understood to have averred about “ sardonic” synthesis of paganism and Calvinism of sixteenth century . There is little of Mendelism in his fiction, for the author may perhaps have his “ own genes” which may have pushed him into spasms “ in sub-conscious state”. His pessimism ( “ the grand finale is tragic”, he says ), seems to spring from a mix of science and metaphysics. Indeed the book would be difficult to comprehend so far as the lay reader is concerned, to intellectuals, it may be thought provoking. To those who are accustomed to Indian philosophy the thoughts expressed in the book may resemble, in a small way, Nachiketa’ s pursuit of knowledge in the Upanishads . The latter did have cogency and definitiveness . This author however, sounds like Abou Ben Adam’s pending quest – pathetically, Adam asks the Geni “ Is my name in the list ?” ––––– The Tribune ( Chandigarh ) March 3, 1984 ","By Prakash Syal A physicist analyses the spirit Here is a book which is rightly dedicated to All the souls in the universe, big and small …″ The author, a post-graduate teacher of physics, poses supra-physics questions – metaphysical questions, questions that traverse the circle from “ why do we exist ?” to “ do we exist at all ?” In his sensitive spiritual outpourings the author agrees with Oscar Wilde that most of us merely exist ; it given only to a few to live. He laments what may be called our static Apolionian existence against which he rebels so he can live a dynamic Dionysian life. Man’ s evolution has got stuck at his physical dimension, he says. The spiritual dimension is his missing link and the mental dimension reflects the technological -age aberration that stems from a lack of spiritual moorings . In his metaphysical musings Subbaram’ s aerial flights take him to various planets, to heaven and hell and purgatory reminding the reader of Milton, Marlowe, and Goethe. He also communes with the great souls of the world. But his questions are contemporary – micro questions of a protestant individual and the macro questions relating to our socio-politico-economic system. The author shows up as a multi -disciplinary scholar who touches on subjects as wide apart as space microbiology , biology and astronomy, on the one hand, and music, painting, drama, psychology and philosophy, on the other. Yearning for absolute freedom like a liberal anarchist , he does not come out as a well -integrated interdisciplinary student capable of profound insights into the human phenomenon . Not prepared to jog with the Joneses, he puts provocative questions but fails to provide coherent and workable answers . Although not enchanting, the book makes interesting reading . ″ ––––– Book Scan, The Hindustan Times ( New Delhi ), Sunday Magazine 1986 By Keki N. Daruwala “ The last great monologuist was Saul Bellow. Even he realized that “ Dialogue, not monologue is the foundation of a civilized life.” Reviewing Andre Gide in 1951 Bellow had remarked “ The truth of monologue is exciting, but it is generally accidental in character ….. As human isolation increases while ","education and abilities multiply the most vital questions and answers become the internal ones. Sadly enough, the number of intelligent people whose most vital conversations are with themselves, is growing. Sadly enough, we have now, what is announced as a ‘ metaphysical monologue’ entitled From Me To You by Mr. K. V. Subbaram from Rohtak. We are told that no long-hand version of the book exists. It “ was created spontaneously straight out of the mind in 25 two-hour sittings at the typewriter”. The first thing I want to do is to compliment Mr. Subbaram on his typing speed. There is considerable passion and energy in the book. The prose is frenetic but seems to be leading you nowhere ….. Actually, it is the reader who starts hanging in the air very soon. What makes things very difficult for him is that there is no paragraphing whatsoever . One does not know where an idea begins and where it ends . He says “ I am too mental oriented (sic). Mother, I am obsessed with mental cravings. But my metaphysical musings have gone astray. The painting bit has gone awry. And now I will go into poetry.” Please don’ t, Mr. Subbaram ! Stick to prose ! ” ––––– By Professor G.N. Devy, formerly professor of English at Nagpur University.

Observation is keen, style is lucid, and each line makes a pleasurable reading. Reviews of the book The Hindustan Times ( New Delhi ) 1986 Shiv K Kumar “ This book of verse is written by a teacher of physics ( like Jayanta Mahapatra – though it doesn’t measure up to that level of excellence.) With the trained scientific sensibility of a physicist Subbaram seldom forsakes precision, brevity, and close observation ….. this is, of course, pressing scientific concepts too palpably into verse which then loses its spontaneity ….. there is indeed a facetious play of irony in most of his poems, and the language is fluid, flippant, treating a variety of themes such as love, divinity, freedom, creation, death, and solitude. The poet tries hard to avoid the use of tame metaphor. Altogether, a promising first collection of verse.” ––––– ","Poetry Tree 1980 : Dropping New Roots, Chandrabhaga ( Cuttack ) 1981 Dev Anand Misra ( A look at some English Poetry published in India in 1980 ) K. V. Subbaram’ s book ( also a first collection ) Splinters in Space-Time contains 30 poems. Subbaram writes a didactic sort of verse that clings to ancient uses of the idiom and the familiar clichés. He, however, appears definite about what he says. He does not waver. This itself indicates how strongly personal Subbaram’ s stance is. But then, throughout his poems, he himself plays an important role ….. Powerful in patches he is unable to sustain the fullness of an image until the end in many of the poems. Subbaram’ s poetry is like a tendril.

Reviews of the book The Hindustan Times ( New Delhi ) 1990 Shiv K Kumar “ During recent years, quite a few scientists have taken to verse writing in English and, as expected, their writing is often chiseled in style and refreshingly contemporary in idiom. Their imagery too is striking since it leans heavily on unusual images taken from quantum or astral physics, biochemistry or any other area of technology. No wonder, one encounters in such poetry a queer juxtaposition of emotion and idea , tradition and modernity, seriousness and facetiousness. The book belongs to this category. Whatever the subject, the poet seems to present it in a scientific perspective. His use of scientific terminology is authentic, because he is professionally a physicist …..

","","The Tribune ( Chandigarh ) 2004 Randeep Wadehra Reflections on life and nature J OHN Keats described poesy as a  drainless shower of light. Others have compared it to a mirror , Cinderella etc. Poetry is all these and more. For a poet it is as much a process of finding solace as it is a weapon for fighting personal and societal demons. Subbaram is not didactic even when he sends out a message. He reflects, and in the process forces us to introspect . While describing Dussehra in his poem Festivity he appears to go against the popular grain,  A king might have had a motive / in leading an army of gibbons / to eliminate a demon of letters / who perhaps could not have been / handled by any other methodology and ends up with  It’ s time to implore: true festivity / is to castigate the evil within, and / that without will cast aside itself . He laments the self-centeredness of today in Strangers All:  One’ s hand does not shake / the other’ s anymore. In fact, he takes a look at different aspects of not only routine life but also nature, as these lines from Monsoon Offering exemplify:  An amalgamated, dark patch / intervenes slyly between / the sky and the earth / waiting to exchange words.

Portions of Publisher′s Note … Sights and Sighs by Kota V. Subbaram is his fourth volume of poems ….. all the four volumes are distinct yet interconnected, one leading to and harking back to another , in terms of theme and technique, sensibility and style ….. wit, humour, sarcasm, irony, metaphor, and paradox are among his many modes and defences . And their range and variety, layers and levels are fascinating and intriguing. All the poems in the collection are poignant and paradoxical , re-readable and quotable, and worth reflecting upon. They offer a beautiful blend of feeling and thought, idea and image, the concrete and the abstract , here and hereafter. They tease and tantalize us at every turn – tease us out of thought and tantalize us into the metaphysical ….. Sights and Sighs is a deeply ambiguous work, the work of a thinker-poet, bordering on the metaphysical .

Subbaram Games Truth Seekers Play is a 3-Act Play that lays bare, in a dramatic setting, the goings-on often inside closed rooms for appointments of faculty members in departments in the university system in India. The vice-chancellor as head of the institution and as chairman of the selection committee ; the head of department for which faculty member is being selected ; the presence of the dean of the concerned faculty ; and the external experts invited for advice in accordance with the statutes of the university, they all form members of a ‘ duly constituted selection committee’ to legitimize the selection procedures. The respective idiosyncrasies and roles of the members for the actual selection of a candidate at a particular rank/s are brought out in a revealing manner. The language is sometimes highfalutin yet at other times quite inflective, and abrasive throughout . The sarcasm and the in-built irony chase the reader for a long time after he has gone through the contents of the Play. This Play is a must read for anyone concerned with Indian universities and their general state of affairs, in particular , with reference to faculty appointments that are long-tenured and have a long-lasting impact on generations of students and on the reputation of the university – autonomous in character in the international arena as an academic institution, expected to be generating new ideas and creating a sustained intellectual environment that makes “then all is well with the Nation and the People,” a la Jawaharlal Nehru.
